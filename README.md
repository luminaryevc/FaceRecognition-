# Face Recognition and Attendance Project

This project aims to develop a system that utilizes face recognition technology to automate attendance tracking. The system will be able to identify individuals through facial recognition and record their attendance in a convenient and efficient manner.

## Features

- Face detection: The system will use computer vision techniques to detect and locate faces in images or video streams.
- Face recognition: Once a face is detected, the system will compare it against a database of known faces to identify the individual.
- Attendance tracking: The system will record the attendance of recognized individuals and store it in a database or export it to a file.
- User interface: A user-friendly interface will be provided to interact with the system, allowing for easy configuration and monitoring.

## Installation

1. Download the pre-trained face recognition model
2. Place the model file in the appropriate directory
3. Run the application: python main.py

## Usage

1. Launch the application.
2. Configure the necessary settings, such as camera input or image directory.
3. Start the attendance tracking process.
4. The system will detect and recognize faces, recording attendance as individuals are identified.
